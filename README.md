# InfecSense 🌱

AI-powered autonomous rover for early crop stress detection and precision pesticide application using multispectral vision and sensor fusion.

---

## Problem Statement

Modern agriculture relies heavily on blanket pesticide spraying, which treats healthy and infected plants equally. This leads to excessive chemical usage, soil degradation, water contamination, and increased costs for farmers.  
Early-stage crop diseases often go unnoticed until visible damage occurs, making intervention late and inefficient.

---

## Our Solution

InfecSense is an autonomous ground rover designed to monitor crop health at the individual plant level.  
It combines multispectral imaging, soil sensing, and AI-based decision-making to detect early plant stress and apply treatment only where required.

## How InfecSense Works

1. Rover autonomously moves through crop rows  
2. Multispectral camera scans plants for early stress indicators  
3. Suspicious plants are re-scanned using RGB vision  
4. Soil moisture and nutrient sensors collect root-zone data  
5. AI fuses all inputs to assess disease likelihood  
6. Precision treatment is applied only if confidence is high  
7. All observations are logged for monitoring and analysis
